/* mbedTLS integrator overrides for the FreeRTOS + lwIP QEMU BDD target.
 *
 * Network-backend twin of Bdd/Targets/FreeRtos/mbedtls_user_config.h — the
 * mbedTLS feature set is transport-agnostic, so the two configs are identical
 * except for the include guard and the transport references in comments. Kept
 * as a separate file (rather than #include of the +TCP one) so each target's
 * config is self-contained and independently tunable.
 *
 * mbedTLS supports an optional integrator config layered on top of its
 * built-in default via `-DMBEDTLS_USER_CONFIG_FILE="path"`. Anything we
 * #define here adds to the default; anything we #undef removes from it.
 *
 * The defaults that mbedTLS picks for a generic build assume a Unix or
 * Windows host — they pull /dev/urandom for entropy, use fopen for cert
 * loading, and call BSD sockets directly. The Cortex-M3 / FreeRTOS QEMU
 * BDD target has none of those, so we strip them and rely on the integrator
 * (BddTargetTlsSender_MbedTls_LwipRawTcp.c) to wire entropy, transport, and
 * cert handles via DI.
 *
 * Anything not touched here keeps mbedTLS's default — including the cipher
 * suite set, RSA, ECC curves, SHA, AES, the PEM parser, x509 parsing, the
 * CTR-DRBG implementation, etc. Trimming further is a binary-size exercise.
